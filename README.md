# In-Bang Website Project (Video Streaming Service Website Project)

## Description
In-Bang is a korean word in short for, "internet videos" in english. This website is a Netflix clone running under Django's backend and React's Frontend.

## Backstory
Our Data Structures and Algorithms course tasked us with a Django (backend) and React (frontend) project. All groups were all given examples of websites that must be proposed; these websites are clones of famous apps like Patreon, Spotify, etc., and for this one, we chose Netflix. We came up with the word "InBang" because I and my other Filipino groupmate can't think of a name. Since we are grouped with our Korean classmate, We Seong Yun, I had the brightest idea to ask him to name our project instead.
